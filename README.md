Analysis of HIV Drug Resistance Data (Linear Regression Models: Final Project)


The scientific goal is to determine which mutations of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) are associated with drug resistance. The data set, publicly available from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/published_analysis/genophenoPNAS2006/, was originally analyzed in (Rhee et al. 2006).
